## Q1: Swell prediction

   - If a storm sets up in the Gulf of Alaska, 4000 km from Tofino,
   with wind speeds of 24 m/s, how long until surfers can expect good
   waves?  (hint, figure out the wave height from the Beaufort scale,
   assuming a well-developed sea, use the ratio of height to
   wavelength to figure out the wavelength).
<!-- ; these waves will be 10-m high or have wavelengths of 200 m. Their -->
<!-- ; group speed will be c = sqrt(gL/2pi)/2 = 8.5 m/s so they will reach Tofino in-->
<!-- ; 5.2 days.  -->
   - What will the period of these deep-water waves most likely be?  
<!-- ;  L = 200 m.  T =200/17 = 11.7 s.  -->
   - Those are pretty decent waves.  They would be even better if they
     were 15-s waves.  How fast would the wind need to be?
<!-- ; L = 15^2g/2/pi = 350m.  h = 0.05*350, therefore hurricane force-->
<!-- ; winds.  -->
    - Suppose the 24 m/s waves are travelling, and gradually move from
    4000 m of ocean to 20 m.  What would you expect the wave height to
    be (assume they become "shallow-water" waves, and that they don't
    change their frequency). Hint: Conserve wave energy into the shallow water.
<!-- ; c_1 h_1^2 = c_2 h_2^2. -->
<!-- ; c_2 = sqrt(gH) = 14 m/s, so sqrt(17/14) = 11 m...-->
    - try to explain why waves that start in the gulf of Alaska often do not
      have such large amplitudes when they reach our shores?

## Q2: Refractions

Consider the bathymetry in the first plot below.  If the waves approach from the south,
where would you expect the strongest waves to be?  Sketch lines of
wavecrests.

## Q3 More swell prediction

Describe the last plot below.  Where are the waves coming from, and what is
their period?  Briefly explain the patterns of green, blue and cyan.
Why does the blue change back to cyan?
