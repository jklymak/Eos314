## Open University: Ocean Circulation and Waves

The text Ocean Circulation is the main text for the course, and is available online at UVic:

<http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/science/book/9780750652780>

The Open University text "Waves" will also be used.  

## Vallis: Climate and the Oceans

<http://voyager.library.uvic.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=2634235>

This text has a very nice introduction to many of the large-scale topics we will cover.  (Beware that the e-version has a funky link to Adobe Digital Editions that you need to go through).


## Talley et al 2011.  

This was used in 2012, but I've decided it is a bit too dense.  However, there are very nice supplementary materials.

## Stewart, 2008

This is more mathematical, and is used extensively for Eos 431.  [Available here](/Readings/Stewart08.pdf).  

## Tomczac and Godfrey

Another book available online, this is a classic of descriptive
physical oceanography.  [Available here](http://www.es.flinders.edu.au/~mattom/regoc/pdfversion.html).


# Other texts

## Dynamics of Marine Ecosystems

Talks about the relationship between ocean physics and its impact on
ocean biology.  Nice clear summaries of the physics.  The biology is
probably a bit advanced.  

## Introduction to Ocean Sciences, D. Segar.  

This is a surprisingly good book that covers all the ocean sciences in
both broad strokes but very precisely and up-to-date.  Graphics are
outstanding, and it is almost worth buying just to have on your coffee
table.

There is a website:

## Dynamical Physical Oceanography, Pond and Pickard

Classic of intro PO text.  More math than warranted for this class.

# Other resources

## Matlab documentation

This should be installed on your machines, but if not

Of particular help will be the sections on Graphics, Programming, and
Data Analysis.
