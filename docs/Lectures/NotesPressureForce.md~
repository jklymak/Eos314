# Things to know

## Salinity
  - How is salinity defined? (briefly - *Emery et al* go into a lot of
    detail I don't expect you to be responsible for)
; grams of salt per kilogram of water
  - How is salinity measured (again, briefly)? 
; chemically, electrically

## Temperature
  This should be review of 110 and common knowledge, but there are
  a few things to remind yourself of.

  - What is the difference between "temperature" and "heat"
; temperature is a molecular property of the fluid and represents how
; fast individual molecules move,  
  - What is the accuracy of an oceanic thermistor?  
; .001 degrees (CHECK)
  - What is "potential" temperature, versus "in-situ" temperature?  
; temperature if the parcel were brought to the surface w/o mixing.
; i.e. removes effects of pressure...

## Density differences 
  
  - What three properties of seawater (primarily) determine its
    density?  
; salinity, temperature, and pressure
  - How does the density vary with those properties?
; 
  - If you change the temperature of seawater by 1 degree C, what is
    the change of density (approximately)?  
; about 1 degree=0.2 kg/m^3 difference: \rho = \rho_0 + 0.2*(T-T_o)
; 5 degrees=-1 kg/m^3
; 1.25 psu = +1 kg/m^3
; 250 dbar = +1 kg/m^3 (non-linear)


## Sound in the ocean
  - What is the approximate speed of sound in the ocean?  
; 1500 m/s
  - What does the sound speed depend on?  
; temperature, salinity, pressure
  - What is the SOFAR channel?  
  - People use the SOFAR channel - do any other mammals?  

## Light in the ocean
  - What transmits better in the ocean, blue or red light?  
  - For clear water, how deep might you still see light?  
; About 200 m... 
  - What factors affect the clarity of the water?  
; stuff in the water...

## Ice
  - How does salt affect the freezing temperature of water?
; makes it lower.  
  - What is meant by "brine rejection"
; when ice does freeze, the salt is not part of the crystals, and falls
; out of the water.
  - Once formed, how does ice affect the interaction of the ocean with
    the atmosphere?
; It can serve to insulate the ocean from the atmosphere.    
  - What is a Polynya?  
; A local region, often caused by wind pushing ice offshore, that is
; exposed to persistent atmospheric cooling.  

## What is pressure?
  - What is pressure from a molecular point of view?
; molecules hitting each other or a container that holds them
  - What happens to the pressure if the temperature is increased?
; usually goes up.
  - What are the units of pressure?  
; Force per area (N/m^2, or kg m/s^2/m^2)

## Hydrostatic Pressure
  - Consider a column of water 10m deep, 1m x 1 m in the horizontal.
    How much does this column of water weigh if it is all at one
    density 1000 kg/m^3?  
; 1000*10*9.8 \approx 10^5 kg m/s^2 (N)
  - How much *force* must be exerted on the bottom of the column to stop
    it from falling?  
; 10^5 N
  - In an ocean at rest that is much deeper than 10 m, what provides the force that holds the upper 10 m from falling (i.e. keeps it in hydrostatic equilibrium)?  
; Pressure!
  - What is the pressure of seawater at this depth?
; 10^5 N/m^2!
  - If the water column was 20 m deep, what is the pressure?
; 2x10^5 N/m^2
  - ***NOTE*** We get tired of carrying around all these extra digits, most
    of which are not likely to be significant, so pressures are often
    written as decibars: 1 dbar = 10^-1 bar = 10^4 N/m^2.  Why do
    you think oceanographers like to use this unit? (Hint, how many
    bars would the pressure at the bottom of a 20-m deep column of
    water be?)
; 1 dbar \approx 1 m
  - What would the pressure be under a column of water where 5 m was
    at 1022 kg/m^3 and the next 5 m was at 1024 kg/m^3?
; 10.0254 dbar (note you need to carry all the decimal places around)

## Pressure gradients
  - If you tilt the water in a bathtub what way does the water flow
    and why?  
; from high to low.
  - Imagine a parcel of water (say 1m x 1m x 1m).  Consider the "x"
    direction only.  If the average pressure on both sides is 98000 N/m^2 (9.8
    dbar), then what is the net force in the x-direction on the block?
; net force is zero
  - Now imagine that the water on the right side of the block is 2 cm
    deeper than on the left side of the block. What is the pressure
    difference across the block?
; 0.02*9.8*1000 N/m^2
  - What is the net force on the block?
; 0.02*9.8*1000 N
  - According to Newton's second law what direction will the block
    tend to be accelerated (in the absence of other forces)?  
; From right to left
  - What is the sign of this compared to the sign of the horizontal pressure
    gradient dP/dx?
; Horizontal pressure gradient is from left to right, so negative.  

## Internal Pressure Gradients.

  - Imagine the seasurface is flat, but there is a two-layer fluid.
  The upper layer has a density of 1000 kg/m^3, and the lower has a
  density of 1010 kg/m^3.  Imagine that you have a box, 1 m wide and
  that the interface between the two fluids is 10 cm from the
  seasurface on one side and 12 cm deep on the other.  Sketch this
  situation.
  - Consider two points at either side of the box 5 cm from the
    surface.  What is the horizontal pressure gradient at this location?
; zero
  - Consider two points on either side of the box at 15 cm depth.
    Approximate the horizontal pressure gradient at this depth.
; 0.02 m * 9.8 m^2/s (1010-1000)kg/m^3 /1m  = 2 N/m
  - What direction will the deep layer be accelerated?
; from the high side to the low side  
  - The upper layer will soon start to move as well.  Why?  
; surface will drop on the high side, drawing water in from left.
