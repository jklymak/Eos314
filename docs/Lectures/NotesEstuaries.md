title: Estuaries and Conservation of Mass and Volume
---

# Reading

  -  Reading that I have made ([Here](/Readings/Estuaries.pdf))
  -  See also Sec S8.8 of the Supplemental of Talley et al, available
     [Here](http://booksite.academicpress.com/DPO/chapter8.php).  

# Things to Learn:

## Estuaries

  - In figure 3, what direction does each layer flow in order to reach "steady-state"?  
  - If the density differences between the layers are equal, which
    layer will initially have the strongest flow?
; probably layer 2.
  - what are the units of salinity?
  - how do you think salinity is measured to make the figures in the reading (i.e. Fig 5,8, and 10)?
  - What is an "isohaline" and  "isopycnal"?  Why are the terms interchangable in an estuary?
  - What is meant by the term "steady state"?  
  - What are the types of estuaries and what parameters determine
    their classification?
<!--- ; 1) Salt-wedge; little mixing.
; 2) Fjord-type: more mixing, often localized at a sill
; 3) Flood-plain: lots of mixing; usually shallow.  
; 4) Also "inverse estuary".  More evaporation than fresh water input.
--->
  - What factors govern the estuarine flow that can change in time?  
<!--- ; buoyancy input;
	  ; tidal forcing (i.e. mixing)
	  ; properties at the ocean side...
--->
  - Be able to describe the effects of topographic blocking in fjords.
<!---
; dense water cannot make it over a sill
; short sill: can get over on strong tides
; long sill: can get over on weak tides
;  Saanich Inlet is a great example.

## Mass (of, for instance, salt) and Volume Conservation

  - Why is it OK to ignore the density of the water when we conserve the
    volume of water?
<!---
; Water is not very compressible, so density can't change just by
; flows alone
--->
  - If water flows through  one hose twice as fast as through an
    identical hose, how does the volume transport between the two
    hoses compare?
<!---; it doubles --->
  - If water flows the same speed through two hoses, but one hose has
    twice the diameter of the other hose, how does the volume
    transport in the two hoses compare?   
<!--- It goes up by a factor of 4. --->
  - If we were interested in the transport of salt down a hose, how
    might we quantify that? i.e. how would we measure how many grams
    of salt per second are travelling down the hose?  
<!--- ; measure the velocity, and the concentration of some salt... --->


## Knudsen Relation

  - What is the salinity of a river?
  - Based on the Knudsen Relation, which term represents the salt transport into the fjord in $ g/s $?
  - Assuming the fjord is in steady state, write an equation for the
    volume budget $m^3/s$, and a second equation for the
    salt budget (all terms are $g/s$ ).  
  - Assume $ R $, $S_i$, and $S_o$ are all known, show that
	$$Q_i = (S_o R)/(S_i-S_o)$$
  - If there is no mixing of the river water, what is $S_o$, and how big
    is $Q_i$?
  - If there is lots of mixing, what happens to $S_i-S_o$ and thus $Q_i$?
  - If you were to do the Knudsen calculation on a fjord-type estuary
    versus a flood-plain estuary, which do you think would tend to
    have the smallest difference between the salinities of the
    outflowing and the inflowing water?  
<!--- ; flood plain --->
