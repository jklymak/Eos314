# Things to know


## Forces that produce tides
  - Tides are produced by what two "forces"?
<!-- ; Centripetal and moon/sun gravity-->
  - Why are there two tides a day?
<!-- ; There is one caused by being close to the moon, one caused by being-->
<!-- ; far from it.  -->
  - What is the shape of the "equilibrium tide"?  
<!-- ; It is a bulge.-->
  - Why is the lunar tide every 12.4 h (12 h and 25 mintues)?
    Sketch...
<!-- ; Because the moon spins in the same direction as the earth.-->

## Tidal variations
  - What is meant by *declination of Moon*?  
<!-- ; It is how high above the equator the moons orbit is.-->
  - Why do declinations result in uneven tides?  
    - what is meant by high-high tide and low-high tide?
<!-- ; When the moon is above the equator, the equilibrium bulge is pulled-->
<!-- ; off the equator.  -->
    - On what period does the moon's declination change?
<!-- ; monthly 27.3 days-->
  - What is the period of the moons elliptical orbit?
<!-- ; Again, 27.3 days-->
    - what do *perigree* and *apogee* mean?
<!-- ; far and close to the -->
    - can this alone explain spring-neap cycles? (How often is the
      spring neap cycle?)
<!-- ; Every 2 weeks, so spring-neap is not caused by this.-->

## Solar/lunar combinations
  - How often does the sun's declination relative to the earth change?
<!-- ; yearly (approximately)...-->
  - How often does it's distance change?  What are the names of the
    closest and furthest distance, and how big are these changes
    relative to the moon's ellipse?
<!-- ; again yearly...-->
  - Why do new and full moons correspond to spring tides?
    - what is the name for this?
<!-- ; syzygy   - forces of moon and sun are aligned.  -->
  - What happens when the moon and sun are directly aligned?
<!-- ; solar eclipse...-->
  - Why are there spring-neap cycles to the tides?

## Dynamic theory
  - How fast would a wave need to travel to follow the bulge of the
    equilibrium tide?  How deep would the ocean need to be to follow
    such a wave? (the earth has a circumfrence of 40,000 km)
<!-- ; about 21 km...-->
  - What other effects prevent an equilibrium tide from being
    observed.
<!-- ; Presence of topography, friction...-->
  - What is meant by an *amphidromic system*?  What direction does water
    flow arond them?
    - what is a *co-tidal* line and a *co-range* line.
  - Describe the practical method for predicting tides.  

## Types of tides
  - Why do different basins have different tides?
