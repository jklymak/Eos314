# Calculate the Ekman Convergence/Divergence...

Suppose we have a wind from the west that increases to the north so
that at 30 N it blows at 0.1 N/m^2, 50 km north it blows at 0.2 N/m^2
and 100 km north it blows at 0.3 N/m^2.  What is the average rate of
Ekman pumping between the wind measurements (in m/s)?  Sketch.  


# Where is the Ekman pumping in N. Pacific?

Based on the figure above, where is there Ekman pumping and suction
(by latitude) in the North Pacific?  How well does this correspond to
the shape of the isopycnals in the upper ocean in the picture below?
