Consider the tide charts in [../../Readings/TideCharts.pdf](../../Readings/TideCharts.pdf) for tides at the
Victoria tidal station.  The charts are annotated with astronomical
events like new moons, etc, and there are three for different months
of the year.  

Very concisely, identify as many tidal phenomena as you can from these
tidal charts by referring to time periods and the astronomical forcing
that creates the signature of the tides during those periods.
Comparing two periods is also helpful. Don't make things up - we should
have covered most of the forcings in class.
