# Things to know

## Pacific water masses

Please see
  - [P16Sections.pdf](../../Readings/P16Sections.pdf)
  - [P16Surfaces.pdf](../../Readings/P16Surfaces.pdf)
  - [P16_PvP_letter.jpg](../../Readings/P16_PvP_letter.jpg)


  - identify the following water masses on the salinity cross section:
    - Subtropical mode water (N. Pacific)
    - Antarcitic Intermediate Water
    - Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW)
  - What direction is the AABW flowing?
  - As it flows, what happens to:
    - Salinity
    - Oxygen
    - Nitrate
  - Silica and Nitrate are both nutrients.  Why do they not look the same?
  - What is Tritium, and why is it measured and plotted?
  - What is $\delta^3He$, and why is it measured and plotted?
  - Overall, where is the "oldest" water found in the Pacific section?  

  - Looking at the surfaces, why do we plot on constant density rather than constant depth?   
  - Along the densest surface,
    -  the water gets fresher towards the north.  How, if its not in contact with the ocean surface?  
    - Any suggestions why higher salinity is piled on the west side of the basin on this deepest density surface?
  - On the near-surface density surface, discuss the salinity distribution.


## Atlantic water masses

Please see
  - [A16Sections.pdf](../../Readings/A16Sections.pdf)
  - [A16Surfaces.pdf](../../Readings/A16Surfaces.pdf)
  - [A16_PvP.jpg](../../Readings/A16_PvP.jpg)


  - Where is the subtropical mode water in the North Atlantic?

  - What are the water masses at approximately 1000 m in the salinity section?  
  - look at the surface at $\gamma^n=27.22$ and $27.95$.  
    - what depths are those in the Atlantic?
    - where is the salty water coming from?

  - In the water deeper than 1500 m compare and contrast the salinity section in the Atlantic to that in the Pacific.
    - sketch which way you think various water masses are moving
    - what are the names of the two deep water masses?  
    - where are they formed?  

  - Based on Oxygen along the $\gamma^n=28.05$ surface, how does the water along this surface flow?   


## Overturning Circulation (OU 6.6)

  - Based on fig. 6.44, where in the world oceans is dense water produced? and in what proportions?
  - How strong is  the overturning circulation believed to be in the
    Pacific?
<!-- ; 5e6 m^3/s -->
  - How does the  strength of the overturning circulation get
    estimated?  
  - If the Pacific Ocean has an area in the horizontal of 10000 km x
    5000 km, what is the velocity associated with the upwelling?  
<!-- ; 5e6 m^3/s=1x10^-7 m/s...  Pretty small... -->
  - How does the path of the NADW differ from the overturning in the
    Pacific?  
  - Dense water pours into the basins (i.e. North Pacific).  What happens to it, assuming the Pacific is in steady state?  i.e. it has to rise and come to the surface again.  How?
