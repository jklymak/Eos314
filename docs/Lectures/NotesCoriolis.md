# Things to understand (Coriolis Force)

From Segar's text:

## Reference Frames
  - Before diving into the reading, please consider the following: If
    you are driving down the road at a steady speed and place a ball
    (or your coffee) on the dashboard, why does it stay there?  
  - If you suddenly accelerate, the ball (or your coffee) falls into
    your lap (if the dashboard is flat).  Why?

## Rotating reference frame
  - What direction does an object moving in a straight line in the
    non-rotating (inertial) frame appear to be deflected in the
    rotating frame?
<!-- ; opposite the direction of rotation...-->
  - What direction does an object moving in a straight line in the
    rotating frame appear to be deflected in the inertial frame?  
<!-- ; bends with the rotating frame-->

## Centripetal Force
  - What stops you from flying off a Merry-go-round?
<!-- ; Friction with the mery go round, or you are holding on.-->
  - Make sure you understand why a ball thrown from the center of the
    merry go round behaves differently from one thrown from off
    center.
<!-- ; Ball in center has no initial momentum, and thus goes in a straight-->
<!-- ; line in the inertial frame.  -->
  - In the rotating frame, it is extremely useful to consider the
    centrifugal force.  This is the opposite of the centripetal force
    necessary to keep you from flying off the merry-go-round.  This
    force does not "exist" but when you are on the merry-go-round you
    definitely "feel" it.  

## Gravitational force on merry go-round
  - Understand the decomposition of the fictional gravity force into
    vertical and horizontal components, and why the horizontal
    component increases with distance from the center of rotation
  - Try to make sense of Figures 12.5 and 12.6.  These are pretty
    complex, but explain a lot of what makes the Coriolis force work.
    - In 12.6, What has a faster speed, a point closer to the outside of
      the merry go-round or one that is closer to the inside?
    - In 12.5 it is very useful to also sketch the centrifugal and
      horizontal gravity forces.  It is complicated because the
      centrifugal force changes. However, you can approximate it as
      being constant.
<!-- ;  As the ball moves towards the center the-->
<!-- ;      gravity force decreases, halting the inward velocity and then-->
<!-- ;      flinging the ball outwards.  As the ball moves outwards, the-->
<!-- ;      gravity force increases again, slowing the outwards motion and-->
<!-- ;      pulling the ball inwards again.-->
  - Try to understand the analogy with the pendulum.  Why does the
    restoring force change as the pendulum swings upwards?
  - To stretch your thinking, what happens if you roll the ball
    tangentially instead of radially to start?  
  - If you know what angular momentum is from physics classes, explain
    the behavior of the ball in terms of the conservation of angular
    momentum.

## Coriolis force on the earth

  - What provides the *centripetal acceleration* that keeps an object on
    the surface of the earth, even in the absence of friction? (Note
    that the text's use of the word pressure for the force the earth
    exterts on a body is somewhat idiosyncratic. You may have seen
    this referred to as the "normal force".)  
  - Why does a projectile fired north appear to veer east in the
    earths frame?  
  - As an object moves east, what is the force balance in the rotating
    frame?  

## Characteristics

  - Where is the Coriolis effect the strongest, at the equator or the
    poles?
     - why?
  - What deflects faster, a fast object or a slow one?
  - What is the Coriolis "force" on a stationary object?  

# Things to know: Ekman Layers

Sec 3.1

## How wind transmits momentum to the ocean
  - wind stress acts on the surface to accelerate it.  What forces act
    to move the water beneath the surface?
  - Why do you think this process is hard to parameterize?
  - Why do we want to parameterize the process?  

## Ekman Layers
   - What forces are the most important to moving water in the Ekman
     layer?  Which ones are unimportant?
<!-- ; Wind stress, internal stress, and Coriolis-->
   - The velocity forms a spiral with depth.    
     - what direction does the spiral spin (in the Northern
       hemisphere)?  
<!-- ; Clockwise-->
     - why?  Sketch a force diagram on a block of water somewhere in
     the Ekman layer.
<!-- ; Water wants to move downwind, but is turned by the Coriolis force. -->
<!-- ; TODO: It would be nice to get a demo-->
   - What direction relative to the wind stress is the mean velocity
     in the Ekman layer?
   - The 2-D *Ekman transport* in the Ekman layer is $\overline{u}D$.
     For a wind stress of $\tau=10\ \mathrm{N/m^2}$, what
     is the transport at 20 N (Hawaii), and 50 N (Station Papa)? Make
     sure the units make sense to you.  

## Convergences

Sec 3.4

  - Water in the Ekman layer is driven by the wind.  How deep does
    the Ekman layer extend?  
  - Below the Ekman layer, does the water move?  If so, how?  
  - We will discuss Convergence and divergence in class.

# Demo
  - Pendulum:  
    - derive restoring force....
    - draw forces...
  - Rotating tank
    - draw forces.  What supplies the centripetal force that holds the
      water in rotation?
