title: Exercise - T/S Diagrams
---

## Construct a T/S diagram

Suppose we have a water column that is initially divided into three water
masses:

z (m)  | T (deg C)  | S (psu)
0-10    |   20        | 30
10-20 |     10        | 31
20-30 |     5         | 30

**Q** Sketch the temperature and salinity vertical profiles (i.e. T(z),
S(z)) i) initially, ii) after
they have undergone some mixing in the vertical, but there is still
some 31 psu water left; iii) after the 31 psu water is mixed away; iv)
steady state.  Assume there is no advection of water (i.e. the column
of water is isolated from other water masses).

**Q** Draw the T/S diagram associated with each of your profile sketches.

**Q** What three Atlantic water masses can you identify in the figure
below (four if you count the surface water)?
