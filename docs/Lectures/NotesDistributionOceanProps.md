# Things to understand

## Setting T-S properties (Sec 4.2)

  - What direction do horizontal gradients tend to be the strongest
      in the ocean?
  - Where in the ocean are T-S properties largely determined?
  - make sure you are clear what is referred to by the terms "zonal"
    and "meridional";  also: "equatorial", "subtropical", "polar" and
    "subpolar", at least their loose meaning.
<!-- ; in the surface mixed layer. They are changed some by mixing and a
; little by geothermal heating. -->

## Surface temperature (4.2.1)
  - Describe the range of surface temperatures and where those
      ranges exist.
<!-- ; 29 in tropics to -2 near poles -->
  - In what direction are the changes the greatest?
<!-- ; Almost all N-S -->

## The thermocline (4.2.2 and 4.2.3)
  - Describe the vertical dist of temperature.
<!-- ; There is usually a shallow mixed layer 50-200 m thick.
; beneath is a sharp thermocline, where the temperature rapidly
; decreases, and then a more gradual decrease.  This is often fit with
; an exponential. -->
  - What is meant by the term "thermocline"?
<!-- ; any region of sharp change of the temperature. -->
  - What two mechanisms does Talley et al give to explain the
      existence of the thermocline?  Why is a "theory" of the
      thermocline needed?  i.e. what causes there to be one at all?
      (We'll discuss more in class).
<!-- ; The thermocline represents warm water being put into the deep ocean.
; If the ocean was just mixed vertically, one might think that the
; whole ocean beneath one point would be one temperature.  However,
; there is cold water at the poles, and warm near the equator.  Thus
; the mixing in the vertical is balanced by a slumping in the
; horizontal. Luyten and Pedlosky also point out that the warm water
; can be pumped down by the wind.  We will examine both further in
; this class. -->
 - What is meant by a "double thermocline" and where do they occur?
<!-- ; midlattidutes denoting "mode water". -->

## Surface mixed layers (4.2.4)
  - Why is there a surface mixed layer?
  - What two mechanisms mix surface water?
<!-- ; Convection (cold water being produced by losing heat to a cold
; atmosphere), and wind mixing (enhanced by Langmuir cells, and other
; turbulent exotica). -->
  - Describe the seasonal cycle of the mixed layer
<!-- ; See figure 4.7. -->
  - Why is the vertical structure of temperature sometimes different
      at high lattitudes?  In what way is it different?
<!-- ; The vertical structure sometimes exhibits a local minima at mid
; depths because the water is produced by melting ice and is therefore
; fresh. -->
  - What would you expect to happen to the mixed layer in a region
      where the days are warm and the nights are cold?  (this is
      called the diurnal cycle).
<!-- ; Daily capping off of temperature.  (see slide) -->

## Deep water and potential temperature (4.2.5)
  - Why does temperature go up with depth in the Mariana Trench?
<!-- ; i.e. from yesterday - water is compressed, causing it to get
; warmer. -->
  - What does potential temperature tell us?
<!-- ; It tells us that the heat content of the water is not actually
; increasing... -->

## Salinity Distribution
  - What sets the ocean salinities?
  - Why are salinity profiles often more complicated than
      temperature profiles?
<!-- ; usually the density does not depend on salinity, so salinity can be "interleaved". -->
  - What is the general vertical trend of the salinities with depth
      in the subtropical gyre?
<!-- ; there is a minimum at about 400 m (eastern), and then it goes up w/ depth. -->
  - Where are the saltiest surface salinities and how salty are
      they?
<!-- ; Med and Red Sea (39 and 41 psu). -->
  - Why is salinity higher in the Atlantic than Pacific?
<!-- ; Largely because of the high evaporation in the Med Sea.  Also E-P is
; larger. -->
  - In terms of the East/West-averaged surface salinities and
      temperatures, which is most important for the surface density?
<!-- ; Temperature is more important. -->
  - Why is E-P negative just north of the equator?
<!-- ; The ITCZ is located there, where there is considerable rain. -->
  - Identify the "intermediate" (~1000 m deep) low- and high-salinity masses in
      figure 4.10b, 4.11b, and 4.12b.
  - where does the low-salinity water appear to come from?
<!-- ; southern ocean at the surface. -->
  - what is the saltiest large water mass in the ocean called? (Based on 4.10b, 4.11b, and 4.12b)
<!-- ; North Atlantic Deep Water. -->

## Density Distribution
  - Considering the density distribution in Fig 4.11c, what direction
      do you think $\sigma_4=45.9$ water is moving?
<!-- ; Northwards -->
  - where does this water come from?
<!-- ; From the Southern Ocean near Antarctica -->
  - Any idea what causes the "bowls" in he near surface densities 20
      S and N?
<!-- ; Wind-driven circulation. -->

## Oxygen, Nitrate and Silicate (4.5 and 4.6)
  - What do each of these tracers tell us about a water mass?
<!-- ; O2: Oxygen is an indicator of how old the water is because of
; respiration, which occurs in the deep unlike photosynthesis.  It is
; also set by the temperature of seawater when it was formed, making
; it somewhat difficult to interpret.
;
; There is an oxygen minimum for a few possible reasons, mostly
; because deep water is "new" as is shallow water, but mid-depth water
; is "old".
;
; Nitrate and Silicate are nutrients.  They tend to be used up by
; biology near the surface, and then rain out to produce high values
; in the deep ocean. -->
