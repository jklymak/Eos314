title: Pressure Gradients in the Ocean

***Q*** A cruise goes out and makes temperature measurements at two
locations 25 km apart as follows:

z (m) | T1 (\\(\mathrm{^oC} \\))  | T2 (\\(\mathrm{^oC}\\))
10     |   10.4    | 10.1
30     |   8.7     |  8.4
50     |    4.7     | 5.2
70     |    4.1     | 4.8

The density of fresh water at 10 degrees is 1008 kg/m^3.  What is the
*approximate* density at each depth if the water is fresh?  (i.e. you
can ignore compressive effects and non-linearities in the equation of
state).

***Q*** What direction would you expect the water to be flowing at each
depth?

***Q*** Approximate the strength and sign of the horizontal hydrostatic pressure
*gradient* at 20, 40, 60 and 80 m, assuming a flat sea surface.  Make
sure you write out the equation so I can check your math.  Does your
answer make sense with the answer above?  Hint: discretize the water column by assuming that it consists of 4 20-m layers of water, each with a constant temperature.  Also, don't round off your denisty values too much!

***Q*** What must the difference in the sea surface height be at the two
stations for your estimated horizontal pressure gradient to be zero at *40 m*?
