# Reading
  - *Skim* Sec 3.1-3.6   [Just Chapter 3](/DescPo/chapter_3Opt.pdf)
  - Please read my notes on the pressure force:
    [HydrostaticPressure](/Readings/HydrostaticPressure.pdf)


# Things to know

## Salinity
  - How is salinity defined? (briefly - *Emery et al* go into a lot of
    detail I don't expect you to be responsible for)
  - How is salinity measured (again, briefly)? 

## Temperature
  This should be review of 110 and common knowledge, but there are
  a few things to remind yourself of.

  - What is the difference between "temperature" and "heat"
  - What is the accuracy of an oceanic thermistor?  
  - What is "potential" temperature, versus "in-situ" temperature?  


## Density differences 
  
  - What three properties of seawater (primarily) determine its
    density?  
  - How does the density vary with those properties?
  - If you change the temperature of seawater by 1 degree C, what is
    the change of density (approximately)?  
<!--- ; about 1 degree=0.2 kg/m^3 difference: \rho = \rho_0 + 0.2*(T-T_o)
; 5 degrees=-1 kg/m^3
; 1.25 psu = +1 kg/m^3
; 250 dbar = +1 kg/m^3 (non-linear)

## Sound in the ocean
  - What is the approximate speed of sound in the ocean?  
  - What does the sound speed depend on?  
  - What is the SOFAR channel?  
  - People use the SOFAR channel - do any other mammals?  

## Light in the ocean
  - What transmits better in the ocean, blue or red light?  
  - For clear water, how deep might you still see light?  
  - What factors affect the clarity of the water?  

## Ice
  - How does salt affect the freezing temperature of water?
  - What is meant by "brine rejection"
  - Once formed, how does ice affect the interaction of the ocean with
    the atmosphere?
  - What is a Polynya?  

## What is pressure?
  - What is pressure from a molecular point of view?
  - What happens to the pressure if the temperature is increased?
  - What are the units of pressure?  

## Hydrostatic Pressure
  - Consider a column of water 10m deep, 1m x 1 m in the horizontal.
    How much does this column of water weigh if it is all at one
    density 1000 kg/m^3?  
<!---; 1000*10*9.8 \approx 10^5 kg m/s^2 (N)--->
  - How much *force* must be exerted on the bottom of the column to stop
    it from falling?  
<!---; 10^5 N -->
  - In an ocean at rest that is much deeper than 10 m, what provides the force that holds the upper 10 m from falling (i.e. keeps it in hydrostatic equilibrium)?  
  - What is the pressure of seawater at this depth?
  - If the water column was 20 m deep, what is the pressure?
  - ***NOTE*** We get tired of carrying around all these extra digits, most
    of which are not likely to be significant, so pressures are often
    written as decibars: 1 dbar = 10^-1 bar = 10^4 N/m^2.  Why do
    you think oceanographers like to use this unit? (Hint, how many
    bars would the pressure at the bottom of a 20-m deep column of
    water be?)
  - What would the pressure be under a column of water where 5 m was
    at 1022 kg/m^3 and the next 5 m was at 1024 kg/m^3?
<!---; 10.0254 dbar (note you need to carry all the decimal places around)--->

## Pressure gradients
  - If you tilt the water in a bathtub what way does the water flow
    and why?  
  - Imagine a parcel of water (say 1m x 1m x 1m).  Consider the "x"
    direction only.  If the average pressure on both sides is 98000 N/m^2 (9.8
    dbar), then what is the net force in the x-direction on the block?
  - Now imagine that the water on the right side of the block is 2 cm
    deeper than on the left side of the block. What is the pressure
    difference across the block?
  - What is the net force on the block?
  - According to Newton's second law what direction will the block
    tend to be accelerated (in the absence of other forces)?  
  - What is the sign of this compared to the sign of the horizontal pressure
    gradient dP/dx?

## Internal Pressure Gradients.

  - Imagine the seasurface is flat, but there is a two-layer fluid.
  The upper layer has a density of 1000 kg/m^3, and the lower has a
  density of 1010 kg/m^3.  Imagine that you have a box, 1 m wide and
  that the interface between the two fluids is 10 cm from the
  seasurface on one side and 12 cm deep on the other.  Sketch this
  situation.
  - Consider two points at either side of the box 5 cm from the
    surface.  What is the horizontal pressure gradient at this location?
  - Consider two points on either side of the box at 15 cm depth.
    Approximate the horizontal pressure gradient at this depth.
<!---; 0.02 m * 9.8 m^2/s (1010-1000)kg/m^3 /1m  = 2 N/m --->
  - What direction will the deep layer be accelerated?
  - The upper layer will soon start to move as well.  Why?
