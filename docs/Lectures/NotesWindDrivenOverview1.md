## Coastal Ocean Response to wind stress

Please consider Figures 1, 2, 3 and 8 of [PerlinEtAl05.pdf](../../Readings/PerlinEtAl05.pdf)
These are taken as a ship steamed back and forth repeatedly across the
line pictured in Fig 1.  The winds are indicated in Fig 2, and the
response of the coastal ocean are shown in Fig.3 The left hand column
is the N/S velocity across the transect, blue means flow to the
south.  

***Q***: What direction does the wind predominantly blow, and what direction
does the water predominantly move?  

***Q***: The wind slackens near 85h.  What happens to the current?  How
quickly?

***Q***: Hypothesize why the current moves the way it does.

***Q***: Recall in [Mixing.pdf](../../Readings/Mixing.pdf) where we calculated the time scale for
diffusion of momentum.  How long would it take for a momentum change
of 1 m/s to diffuse to the sea floor if the viscosity were molecular
(nu = 1e-6 m^2/s)?  What if it were moderately turbulent (K = 1e-3
m^2/s)?

***Q***: What is happening near the sea floor?  Why?  

***Q***: What other patterns do you see and wonder about?  

## Pacific Ocean Surface properties:  

Consider the data plotted in [SurfaceCurrentsAll.pdf](../../Readings/SurfaceCurrentsAll.pdf).  The
First 12 pages are monthly plots of surface properties:

  a) Sea surface winds - arrows indicate magnitude and direction,
  color represents magnitude.  

  b) Net heat flux - negative means the ocean is losing heat.  

  c) Surface currents - arrows indicate magnitude and
  direction. shading represents magnitude.  These panels also have sea
  surface elevation contoured in 25-cm intervals.  

  d) Sea-surface temperature.  

I found the arrows hard to look at in c) so I replotted in the last
two pages images of the N/S and E/W currents respectively.  Red-ish is
to the N or E, respectively, Blue-ish to the S or W.  Again, sea
surface height is contoured on top.  

***Q***: Pick out 2 or 3 patterns you can see *evolving* in each of the panels
as the year progresses.  Which properties change the most?

***Q***: What features dominate the sea-surface currents?

  - What are their time scales?  
  - How do they correspond with the sea-surface height?  
  - How do they correspond with the "forcing" (i.e. wind and heat
  fluxes)?
  - What features can you not explain with the forcing?  

***Q***: Speculate on how you think each data set is collected?
