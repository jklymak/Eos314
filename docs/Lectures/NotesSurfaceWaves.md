# Things to know

## Basic wave parameters
  - be able to define wavelength, wave height, amplitude, period and
    frequency.  
<!-- ; wavelength is the space between crests.  -->
<!-- ; wave height is the vertical distance from crest to trough-->
<!-- ; amplitude is the vertical distance from resting to the peak.-->
<!-- ; period is how long the wave passing a stationary point takes to go-->
<!-- ; through one cycle.-->
<!-- ; frequency is 1/T, the period. -->
  - what is meant by "phase speed"?  
<!-- ; Phase speed is how fast individual crests move.  -->

## What are waves?  
  - What characteristics does the text list for waves?
<!-- ; - transmits energy or a disturbance from one part of the medium to-->
<!-- ; another.-->
<!-- ; - Doesn't necessarily move the medium-->
<!-- ; - wave form can stay the same.-->
<!-- ; - propagates with a constant speed. -->
  - What is the difference between a progressive and standing wave?
<!-- ; A standing wave can be thought of as two progressive waves-->
<!-- ; travelling in opposite directions.  -->
  - What are the two restoring forces for surface waves on water?
<!-- ; surface tension and gravity  -->
    - What is the difference between capillary and gravity waves?
<!-- ; capillary the restoring force is largely surface tension and gravity waves are gravity.-->

## Wind-generated waves
  - Describe Jeffries' sheltering theory for how wind waves are
    generated.  
<!-- ; The wind blows over the waves with the windward side getting more-->
<!-- ; force than the downwind side.  This piles the waves up further.  -->
  - What is the average steepness of open-ocean wind generated waves?
<!-- ; ~5:100, ie. about 20 times wider than high.  -->
  - What ratio of wind-to-wave speed is the most efficient at
    generating waves?
<!-- ; waves grow until they have a wave speed of about 1/3 the wind-->
<!-- ; speed.  the interaction at this speed is the most efficient.  -->
  - Why don't the waves increase in size indefinitely?  
<!-- ; energy dissipates via friction-->
<!-- ; energy dissipates via white capping (kind of the same).  -->
<!-- ; some energy goes into non-wave motions.  -->
  - What is meant by a *fully developed sea*?
<!-- ; It is a sea in which the energy put in by the wind is dissipated at-->
<!-- ; the same rate.    -->
    - From fig 1.4, do you expect low or high frequency waves to
    become more important as the wind gets stronger in a fully
    developed sea?  Why?
<!-- ; Low-frequency waves.  The wave height goes up, so does the-->
<!-- ; wavelength.  And these waves will have longer periods.  -->

## Wave height and steepness
  - What is meant by *significant wave height*?  Why is such a concept
    used?
<!-- ; Significant wave height is the height of the highest 1/3 of the-->
<!-- ; waves.  -->
  - Take a look over the Beaufort Scale.  At what scale do whitecaps
    start to form?  At what scale does *spindrift* start to form?  (What
    is *spindrift*?)
<!-- ; Whitecaps: scale 3.  Spindrift: scale 7.  -->
    - Have a look at the pictures at:
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_Scale

## Wave forms and motions
  - If a wave is sinusoidal in space, and it passes you at a constant
    speed, how will it look in time?
<!-- ; It will also be sinusoidal...-->
  - For sinusoidal waves in deep water, what is the trajectory traced out by a water
    parcel?  How does this trajectory change with depth?
<!-- ; A circle.  -->
  - What happens to the orbits of a water parcel if the water is "shallow".
<!-- ; It becomes compressed at the bottom.  -->
  - What is meant by "wave speed" and how do you calculate it?  
<!-- ; It is the speed of individual crests past a point.  -->
  - What are the *wavenumber* and *angular frequency*?  (These are often
    used for notational convenience).
<!-- ; wavenumber = 2pi/wavelength.  angular frequency = 2pi/T-->
  - Wave speeds
    - The wave speed of "deep" waves depends on?
<!-- ; wavelength (c = sqrt(gL/2pi));-->
    - The wave speed of "shallow" waves depends on?
<!-- ; water depth (c = sqrt(gH))-->
  - What assumptions are made in linear surface wave theory?
<!-- ; waves are sinusoidal-->
<!-- ; amplitudes are small compared to wavelengths and depths-->
<!-- ; viscocity and surface tension small-->
<!-- ; Coriolis force and vorticity small-->
<!-- ; depth not changing-->
<!-- ; three-dimensionality is not important.-->

## Dispersion and Group Speed
  - If a storm hits a region, an observer on a beach will encounter
    long or short waves first?  
<!-- ; long waves-->
  - What is the difference between *group* speed and *wave* speed?
<!-- ; group speed is the speed that a packet of waves travels at.  It-->
<!-- ; tends to be slower than the speed that the crests travel at.  -->
  - Does the explanation of the difference on page 20 make sense to
    you?
<!-- ; SHOW IN CLASS.-->
  - what is the group speed of shallow water waves?
<!-- ; = sqrt(gH)-->
  - what is the group speed of deep-water waves?
<!-- ; = 1/2 sqrt(gL/(2\pi))-->
  - Why doesn't the difference between group and wave speeds matter in
    shallow water?
<!-- ; the phase speed doesn't change with wavelength, so all waves travel-->
<!-- ; at the same speed and there is no dispersion...-->


## Wave Energy
  - What are the two forms of energy in a fluid?
<!-- ; potential and kinetic...-->
  - How does the energy depend of the height of the (linear) wave?
<!-- ; H^2. -->
  - How fast does wave energy propagate?
<!-- ; with the group speed.   -->
  - Skim the section on "swell"....

## Refraction and shoaling
  - What is meant by refraction?   
<!-- ; As water gets shallower, the waves slow down, so waves tend to align-->
<!-- ; themselves with isobaths.-->
  - What happens to waves as they get in shallower water?
<!-- ; they slow down.    -->
  - What is the meaning of eq, 1.13?  What does it imply about the
    *flux* of energy?  
<!-- ; it means that the flux remains constant.-->
  - What are the four types of breaking waves on a beach?
<!-- ; Spilling-->
<!-- ; Plunging-->
<!-- ; Collapsing-->
<!-- ; Surging-->

## Special waves
  - Explain what happens to the wavelength of waves propagating into a
    current and with a current.  
<!-- ; It is compressed...-->
  - Why are giant waves seen off the SE tip of Africa? How large do
    they reach?
<!-- ; Strong waves from Southern Ocean encounter the Algulhuas current.-->
  - What causes tsunamis?  
<!-- ; earthquakes or landslides-->
    - how fast do they travel (are they shallow or deep waves?)
<!-- ; c = sqrt(hg) = 200 m/s (h = 4000 m);-->
