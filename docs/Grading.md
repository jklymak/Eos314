---

Late work penalized as 10% per day, max 5 days.  Academic concessions will be granted
with appropriate documentation as per [UVic's regulations](http://www.uvic.ca/registrar/students/policies/appeals/rac-request.php).


## 5% Class reading and discussion

Most of the classes will be based around co-operative learning.
Students will be responsible for having read the chapter material
before class.  During class you will have the opportunity to review
this material with your classmates, and then we will summarize the
important points as a class.  This will be supplemented by in-class
exercises, and lab demos.

While this grade is subjective, co-operative learning can only happen
if most folks co-operate, and your effort should be reflected in your
grade.

  - See the class [Outline](../Outline) for readings and links to study questions.

## 20% Data analysis projects ("Labs")

The afternoons will be spent learning some basic aspects of analyzing
large data sets.  This will require you to turn in modified versions
of code and supplementary material.  

  - See [Labs](http://web.uvic.ca/~sarahjt/OSM/314Labs/)

## 15% Excercises (in and out of class)

There will be a number of exercises that test your comprehension
and give you practice in the quantitative aspects of the course.
Again, some will be graded, others will not.

## 30% Quizzes

There will be two quizzes of equal weight.  There may be some
cumulative questions on the second quiz, testing all that has come
before, but in general you will be tested on the material directly previous.

  - See the [Outline](../Outline)  for dates.  

## 30% Saanich data-analysis report

You will each be writing and handing in a cruise report based on the
data collected in Saanich Inlet, supplemented with regional data from
VENUS, and the local weather.  This will be due during the exam period
(Date TBA).

Late policy for the report is -10% per day, including weekends.  

  - See [Final Project](../CourseProject) for details.
